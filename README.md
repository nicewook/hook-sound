# Claude Code Hook Sound

üîä Add sound notifications to Claude Code's hooks feature for Stop and Notification events.

> üá∫üá∏ **English** | [üá∞üá∑ **ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥**](README.ko.md)

## macOS Only

This tool is designed specifically for macOS and uses the built-in `afplay` command for audio playback.

## What it does

This project enhances Claude Code's hooks functionality by adding audio feedback:

- **Stop Hook**: Plays a completion sound when Claude Code stops processing
- **Notification Hook**: Provides audio alerts for various Claude Code notifications

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Run the installation script:

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
- Copy the `script/` folder to `~/.claude/script/`
- Copy the `voice/` folder to `~/.claude/voice/`
- Make `stop_voice.sh` and `notification_voice.sh` executable
- Display installation confirmation

## Files Included

- **script/stop_voice.sh**: Executable script that plays completion sounds (randomly selects from multiple files)
- **script/notification_voice.sh**: Executable script that plays notification sound
- **voice/**: Directory containing various notification sound files (generated with [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io))
  - **For Stop Hook (completion sounds):**
    - `all_good.mp3`
    - `done_what_else.mp3`
    - `ready_to_go.mp3`
    - `thats_it.mp3`
    - `were_done.mp3`
  - **For Notification Hook (alert sounds):**
    - `what_do_you_think.mp3`
    - `what_is_your_choice.mp3`

**Customization**: You can replace any MP3 files in the `voice/` folder with your own audio files. The stop hook will randomly play from the 5 completion sound files, while the notification hook randomly selects between `what_do_you_think.mp3` and `what_is_your_choice.mp3`.

## Claude Code Configuration

After installation, you need to configure Claude Code to use the hooks. Add the following to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Notification": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "$HOME/.claude/script/notification_voice.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    "Stop": [
      {
        "matcher": "",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "$HOME/.claude/script/stop_voice.sh"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

If your `settings.json` already exists, just add the `hooks` section to the existing JSON structure.

## Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **You must restart Claude Code after installation** for the hooks to take effect.

## How it works

The sound notifications integrate with Claude Code's hooks system to provide audio feedback during your coding sessions, making it easier to know when Claude has finished processing without constantly watching the screen.

## Verifying Installation

To check if the installation was successful:

1. Verify files exist:
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/script/
ls -la ~/.claude/voice/
```

2. Test sound playback manually:
```bash
~/.claude/script/stop_voice.sh
~/.claude/script/notification_voice.sh
```

3. Check Claude Code settings:
```bash
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep -A 20 "hooks"
```

## Troubleshooting

### No sound is playing
- Ensure your Mac's volume is turned up
- Check that the audio files exist: `ls ~/.claude/voice/`
- Test audio playback: `afplay ~/.claude/voice/all_good.mp3`
- Verify scripts are executable: `ls -la ~/.claude/script/`

### Hooks not triggering
- Restart Claude Code after installation
- Verify your `~/.claude/settings.json` configuration
- Check that the script paths use `$HOME` instead of `~`

### Permission issues
- Re-run the installer: `./install.sh`
- Manually set permissions: `chmod +x ~/.claude/script/*.sh`

### Different audio files
- Replace any MP3 files in `~/.claude/voice/` with your preferred sounds
- Keep the same filenames or update the script arrays accordingly

## Requirements

- macOS
- Claude Code with hooks feature enabled
- Audio output capability
